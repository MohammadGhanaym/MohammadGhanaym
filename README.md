  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
  - Descriptive Statistics  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Data Visualization and Reporting

### 2. **Customer Personality Analysis**  
- **Objective**: In this project, I analyzed the characteristics of a sample of IFood customers who accepted the last campaign offer. I helped them identify customers who are more likely to accept an offer, enabling them to make personalized campaigns to target the right customers and save money.
- **Key Insight:** The higher the customer's education level, the more likely they are to accept an offer.
- **Skills Used**:  
  - Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables, DAX, Data Cleaning).  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
  - Data Visualization and Reporting.

### 2. **A/B Testing Analysis: Evaluating the Impact of a New Treatment Page on Conversion Rates**  
- **Objective**: Analyzed the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website to determine whether the new treatment page led to higher conversion rates than the old page. The goal was to recommend whether to implement the new page, keep the old page, or extend the experiment duration.  
- **Key Insight**: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the new page conversion rate is better than the old one.  
- **Skills Used**: Python, Probability, A/B Testing, Logistic Regression.
