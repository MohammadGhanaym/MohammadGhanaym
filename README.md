## ðŸ“Š Data Science Projects  

### 1. **Bridging the Gap: Addressing the 37% Loss in Hardware Opportunities**  
- **Objective**: In this analysis, I investigated data from a computer hardware company to evaluate the performance of its sales teams and agents. By examining key metrics such as total bookings, average deal size, win rate, and time to close, we can uncover actionable insights to enhance sales performance, minimize lost opportunities, and increase profitability. 
- **Key Insight**: The company achieved total bookings of approximately $10 million and closed 6,711 deals, with a win rate of 63.15%. This translates to a deal loss rate of approximately 37%. 
- **Skills Used**:  
  - Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables, DAX, Data Cleaning).  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
  - Data Visualization and Reporting.  
- **Project Link**: [View the Project](https://github.com/MohammadGhanaym/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/CRM%20Sales%20Opportunities%20Analysis)  

### 2. **A/B Testing Analysis: Evaluating the Impact of a New Treatment Page on Conversion Rates**  
- **Objective**: Analyzed the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website to determine whether the new treatment page led to higher conversion rates than the old page. The goal was to recommend whether to implement the new page, keep the old page, or extend the experiment duration.  
- **Key Insight**: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the new page conversion rate is better than the old page conversion rate.  
- **Skills Used**: Python, Probability, A/B Testing, Logistic Regression.  
- **Project Link**: [View the Project](https://github.com/MohammadGhanaym/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/main/Analyze_ab_test_results)
